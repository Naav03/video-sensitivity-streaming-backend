# video-sensitivity-streaming-backend

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains the backend implementation of a secure video upload, processing, and streaming platform. The system allows authenticated users to upload videos, automatically processes them for content sensitivity analysis, and enables secure video streaming with real-time progress updates.

The backend is built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io**, following a modular and scalable architecture. It supports **multi-tenant user isolation**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and **HTTP range-based video streaming** for efficient playback.
